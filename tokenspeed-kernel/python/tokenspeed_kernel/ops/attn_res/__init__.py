    """Fused Attention-Residual forward.

    Candidates are ``block_residual[0..K-1]`` followed by ``layer_residual``
    (N = K + 1). Computes ``softmax_n(<RMSNorm(v_n), rms_weight * res_weight>)``
    over candidates, then the weighted sum of the raw candidates.

    Args:
        layer_residual: bf16 ``[T, H]`` current residual stream.
        block_residual: bf16 ``[K, T, H]`` K periodic snapshots.
        res_weight: bf16 ``[H]`` scorer projection weight.
        rms_weight: bf16 ``[H]`` RMSNorm weight.
        eps: RMSNorm epsilon.
        out_norm_weight: optional bf16 ``[H]``; when given, the following
            RMSNorm is fused into the epilogue and the return value is the
            normed mix.
        out_norm_eps: Optional output RMSNorm epsilon. Defaults to ``eps``.
